## Migration Guide
Not applicable for initial release.

## Deployment Instructions

1. Deploy contracts to Stacks testnet in the following order:
    - material-sourcing.clar
    - application-service.clar
    - seasonal-timing.clar
    - quantity-calculation.clar
    - decomposition-monitoring.clar

2. Initialize contract data:
    - Set initial mulch specifications
    - Register initial regions
    - Configure delivery zones
    - Set decomposition rates

3. Verify deployment:
    - Run test suite against deployed contracts
    - Verify read-only functions return expected data
    - Test basic workflows end-to-end
