# Tokenized Decentralized Garden Mulch Distribution Networks

A blockchain-based ecosystem for managing organic mulch distribution, quality verification, and garden maintenance services using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized network for garden mulch distribution that tokenizes various aspects of the mulch lifecycle, from sourcing to decomposition monitoring. The system ensures quality, optimizes timing, and provides transparent tracking of mulch services.

## Smart Contracts

### 1. Material Sourcing Contract (`material-sourcing.clar`)
- Manages organic mulch procurement from verified suppliers
- Implements quality verification standards
- Tracks supplier reputation and certification
- Handles payment distribution to suppliers

### 2. Application Service Contract (`application-service.clar`)
- Coordinates mulch spreading services
- Manages garden bed preparation requirements
- Tracks service provider performance
- Handles service booking and payment

### 3. Seasonal Timing Contract (`seasonal-timing.clar`)
- Determines optimal mulch application schedules
- Considers climate data and seasonal patterns
- Provides timing recommendations for different regions
- Manages seasonal pricing adjustments

### 4. Quantity Calculation Contract (`quantity-calculation.clar`)
- Estimates mulch requirements based on garden dimensions
- Calculates costs for different mulch types
- Provides bulk pricing discounts
- Optimizes delivery logistics

### 5. Decomposition Monitoring Contract (`decomposition-monitoring.clar`)
- Tracks mulch breakdown rates over time
- Monitors soil health improvements
- Schedules replacement notifications
- Maintains historical decomposition data

## Key Features

- **Tokenized Rewards**: Earn tokens for quality mulch supply and service provision
- **Quality Assurance**: Blockchain-verified quality standards and supplier ratings
- **Seasonal Optimization**: Smart timing recommendations based on regional data
- **Cost Efficiency**: Automated quantity calculations and bulk pricing
- **Sustainability Tracking**: Monitor environmental impact and soil health

## Token Economics

- **MULCH Tokens**: Primary utility token for network transactions
- **Quality Staking**: Suppliers stake tokens to guarantee quality
- **Service Rewards**: Service providers earn tokens for completed jobs
- **Governance Rights**: Token holders participate in network decisions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks wallet for transaction signing
- Basic understanding of Clarity smart contracts
- Node.js for running tests

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run tests: `npm test`
